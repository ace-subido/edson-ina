                    <p>
                      We were asked to assemble in Edson’s condominium to meet and practice for the proposal song. Matching the color of the roses to be given to Ina, we were asked to wear either red (or white). One by one the groggy, albeit half-awake, friends started arriving. The room started to fill with #ActsOfEdson stories and music.
                    </p>
                    <p>The plan was simple. While Ina was attending Sambang Gabi at Fort, we will arrange ourselves at her house, the friends will sing the song, and then Edson will propose. But moments like these are never just about the logistics. With our hopeful hearts, we drove early towards Ina’s house. There, we were greeted by Tita Patty who enthusiastically narrated that she had to feign illness to skip Sambang Gabi so she could witness the event preparation.</p>

                    <h3>Rehearsal Time</h3>
                    <p>
                      As the time of Ina’s arrival grew nearer, each song practice became harder and harder. Try as we might, we couldn’t hold back our tears. Our hearts overflowed with love and encouragement for Edson. We were so chocked up with emotions that we could hardly sing. And that was only how we were feeling; I could only imagine how Edson was feeling and what was going on in his head.
                    </p>

                    </h3>
                    <p>
                      We got the instructions to go to our places and standby. Skype was set up and even Edson’s parents were ready on the receiving end. Everyone was excited to witness Ina’s reaction. Ina enters the veranda and for a while, no notes came out from our mouth as we tried to sing. Who would be able to sing, when the love scene you only see and feel on movies, is actually happening before our very eyes?  We had to catch our breath.  We had to pause so we could get back to our senses and fulfill our duties – and that is to sing while Edson proposes.  But honestly, I don’t remember singing very well- half the time I was just really crying tears of joy. And half the time I was just crying tears of joy even more.

                      Dear Ina mylove. <br /><br />

                      Last September 3, 2012 before answering me with your sweet yes, you asked me this question from Nehemiah 2.4-5 "What is it that you want Edson?" <br /><br />

                      I am in faith that it has come to this point that The King is asking me the same question again,
                      "So the King asked me, what is it that you want Edson?" <br /><br />

                      And I replied, "If it pleases the King, and if I have found favor in Your sight, I would like to ask the hand of Your princess Ma. Kristina Isobel B. Mendez to be my queen." <br /><br />

                      Having answered that, Ina mylove, will you be my queen, will you marry me?

                      This is the moment that romantic movies are made of. Edson falls on one knee, and asks Ina “Ina mylove, will you be my queen, will you marry me?” <br /><br />

                      Ina, shocked and in tears, hugs Edson tightly and responds with a “Yes!”
